Shivam Vats : who is tony stark?
Sage : Tony Stark is a billionaire inventor and industrialist, also known as Iron Man!
Shivam Vats : is he real?
Sage : Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. He's a superhero and a founding member of the Avengers. Unfortunately, he's not real in the real world.
Shivam Vats : tellme his whole life story
Sage : That's a long story! Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, was born to Howard and Maria Stark. His father was a wealthy industrialist and inventor who founded Stark Industries. Tony was a genius from a young age and his father encouraged his interest in science and technology.
Tragedy struck when his parents were killed in a car accident. Tony inherited Stark Industries and became its CEO at the age of 21. He continued his father's work, focusing on developing advanced technologies, including the Iron Man suit.
During a business trip to Afghanistan, Tony was kidnapped by a terrorist group and forced to build a missile system. Instead, he built the first Iron Man suit to escape. He returned to the US and continued to refine the Iron Man technology.
Tony became a superhero, using the Iron Man suit to fight crime and protect the world. He became a founding member of the Avengers, a team of superheroes dedicated to saving the world from threats too powerful for any one hero.
Over the years, Tony struggled with personal demons, including his ego, his relationships, and the guilt of his actions. He also had to deal with the consequences of his creations, such as Ultron, an artificial intelligence that turned against humanity.
Tony's relationships were also a significant part of his story. He had a close friendship with Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, but their differing views on the Sokovia Accords led to a rift between them. He also had romantic relationships, including with Pepper Potts, who eventually became the CEO of Stark Industries.
In Avengers: Infinity War, Tony faced his greatest challenge when the Mad Titan Thanos collected all six Infinity Stones and wiped out half of all life in the universe. In Avengers: Endgame, Tony played a crucial role in the Avengers' plan to undo the damage caused by Thanos. He made the ultimate sacrifice, using the Infinity Stones to defeat Thanos and his army, but at the cost of his own life.
Tony Stark's legacy lived on, and his actions inspired a new generation of heroes, including Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.

Shivam Vats : when a number is divided by 55 the remainder is 28. What will be the remainder when the same number is divided by 13?
Sage : Let's solve this problem!
Since the remainder is 28 when divided by 55, we can write:
x = 55k + 28
We want to find the remainder when x is divided by 13. Let's try to express x in terms of 13:
x = 55k + 28
= (13 × 4 + 3) + 28
= (13 × 4) + 3 + 28
= (13 × 4) + 31
= 13(4 × 4) + 31
Now, when x is divided by 13, the remainder will be:
31 mod 13 = 6
So, the remainder when x is divided by 13 is 6.
Shivam Vats : where is k?
Sage : I apologize for the mistake. The correct solution is:
x = 55k + 28
= (13 × 4 + 3)k + 28
= (13 × 4)k + 3k + 28
= 13(4k) + 3k + 28
Now, when x is divided by 13, the remainder will be:
3k + 28 mod 13
To find the exact remainder, we need to know the value of k.
